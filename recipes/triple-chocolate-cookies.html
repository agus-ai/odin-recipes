        <h3>Delicious chocolates merged in one cookie!</h3>
        <p>Large or small, these triple chocolate cookies are crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. Refrigerating the batter for 48 hours before baking is ideal, as this allows the dough to fully form its flavor.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>3/4 cup of brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
            <li>1/cup of white sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cup of all purpose flour</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon of baking soda</li>
            <li>Chocolate
                <ul>
                    <li>1 cup of milk chocolate chips</li>
                    <li>1 bar of dark chocolate, cut into chunks</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoon of white chocolate chips</li>    
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine brown sugar, butter, white sugar, and salt in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until a creamy, deep brown mixture forms. 
                <br>Add egg and vanilla; beat until mixture lightens and becomes smooth, 10 to 15 seconds.</li>
            <li>Mix flour and baking soda together in a separate bowl. Add slowly to the wet ingredients until mostly incorporated, but some white traces of flour remain.
                <br> Fold in milk chocolate, dark chocolate, and white chocolate using a spatula, not the mixer. Cover the dough and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 48 hours.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) when ready to bake.</li>
            <li>Divide cold dough into 2 1/4-ounce portions and place on a cookie sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the edges start to look golden brown and crispy, 10 to 12 minutes.
                <br> Do not overbake; the centers will not look fully done. Cool until cookies are set, about 30 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
